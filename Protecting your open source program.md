# From Vulnerability to Vigilance: Protecting Your Open Source Program and Community

### Abstract:

Open source program offices (OSPOs) play a crucial role in guiding organizations on securely and effectively releasing open source software. This presentation aims to provide valuable insights into implementing robust security measures within OSPOs, enabling them to establish strong security guardrails for their open source communities. The focus will be on leveraging GitHub repository settings, identifying code vulnerabilities, and formulating effective response strategies for addressing security issues.

### Description:

Open source projects often face security challenges, making it imperative for OSPOs to adopt proactive security measures. This presentation will delve into the various security features offered by GitHub at no cost, empowering OSPOs and open source projects to safeguard against vulnerabilities effectively. We will provide a comprehensive overview of these features and demonstrate how OSPOs can leverage them to bolster the security of their projects.

Additionally, we will explore common pitfalls and mistakes frequently encountered by developers when securing their projects, offering valuable insights on how to avoid them. By the end of the presentation, attendees will gain a better understanding of the essential practices required to ensure the security of their open source projects on GitHub, underscoring the significance of this aspect for the success of their initiatives.
