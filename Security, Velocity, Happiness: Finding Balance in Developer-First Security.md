The principles of shift-left security have been embraced with the noble goal of empowering developers to detect and address security vulnerabilities early in the development process. In this presentation, we will delve into the intricate interplay between security, development velocity, and developer happiness within the realm of application security.

We will critically examine the concept that developers should shoulder the entire responsibility for the security lifecycle of their applications, given the existing models of application security. Moreover, we will propose alternative approaches that strike a harmonious balance between security practices and development efficiency.

Join us as we explore cultural and programmatic strategies to foster an environment where developers can confidently build secure software without sacrificing speed or fulfillment. By embracing these approaches, organizations can pave the way for a thriving and secure software development process.
